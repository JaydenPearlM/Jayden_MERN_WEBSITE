Welcome to my TechWise Project:

In the main Branch is the real file for the Mern website.

The 2nd Branch has all the day folders.

How to run this:

In vscode, run the folder and look into its contents:

Devfolio is the Server and Devfolio_client is the React App.

Load it up, split the terminal and run both npm run dev and npm start in the front end and backend.

The react and backend should come up and you can play through the website.

You can upload files tp show on the home page and if you click on veiw demo on the project card, it should bring up your file uploads, github, deployment links.
by default though its the Admin page.

Features to have in the future:
- More Pastel colors used nicely through out the web app
- project card UI
- Security Features
- Login/Password
- About me section
- And I may just put a hobby page in to showcase my artwork too
